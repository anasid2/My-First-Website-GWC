<h1 style = "color:blue; background-color:yellow">A little bit about Me</h1>
 <p style= "color:cyan"> Well, my life isn't perfect, but worth living for tbh. Life is a roller coaster full of emotions and excitment and that's exactly how my
   life is set up. I'm sixteen years old. My birthday is September 14,2000 so i'm a Virgo. I'm an ambitious and out going person who
  always tries to find the positive things out of the negative sides. I love to care, support, and help people who need it the most.</p>
    <h2 style = "color:red; background-color:Aquamarine">My Family</h2>
<p style = "color:blueviolet">So my family is pretty big from my perspective probably because of what i'm mixed with. I'm half arab because of my mother who is from 
Saudi Arabia and half pakistani because of my father who is from Pakistan. My mother's side of the family all live in Saudi Arabia and my
father's side is spread out around the world. I have 5 aunts, 4 uncles, and 21 cousins on my mothers side of the family where two of the
girls are married and have 1 kid of their own. My father's side of the family on the other hand I have 2 uncles who live here and 4 aunts
where 1 lives in North Carolina, 1 in Texas, 1 in Dubai, and 1 in Pakistan. I have 18 cousins on my father's side where 4 of them are married
and 3 of the have kids and 1 is engaged. I myself have 3 younger brothers, so i'm the oldest. But, my family extendes even futher around the
world, because of my grandparents from both sides where they have more and then 1 sister and 1 brother where they have more than 1 kid. </p>
  <h3 style = "color:coral; background-color:cornflowerblue">Likes and dislikes</h3>
<p style = "color:darkorange"> During my free time, I like to draw and write. I actually love to write all the time and I could literally 
  write about anything. Whenever I have a mood instead of talking to people about it
