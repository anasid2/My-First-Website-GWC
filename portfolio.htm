<h1>A little bit about Me</h1>
<p>Well, my life isn't perfect, but worth living for tbh. Life is a roller coaster full of emotions and excitment and that's exactly how my
life is set up. I love food, babies, and traveling. I love to explore and learn new things about places, people, and the overall environment.
When I grow up I want to be a Neurosurgeon, so I can be able to travel with my family all the time. I'm an out-going person who likes to 
help, support, and care for the people who need it most. I'm half arab and half pakistani, so I love spicy food and can eat it all the time,
but I love to eat choclate and chips. The only types of choclate I can't stand eating are the ones with nuts, caremel, white choclate, and
dark choclate.
